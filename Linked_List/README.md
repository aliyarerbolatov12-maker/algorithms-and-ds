### Linked List

A **linked list** is a linear data structure where each element (called a _node_) contains a value and a reference (or pointer) to the next node in the sequence. This allows efficient insertions and deletions at any position in the list, unlike arrays which require shifting elements.

**Example structure:**

```
head -> [value | next] -> [value | next] -> [value | next] -> null
```

**Key points:**

- Each node points to the next node.
- The first node is called `head`.
- The last node points to `null`.
